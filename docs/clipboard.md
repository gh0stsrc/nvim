# ðŸ“‹ Neovim Clipboard Configuration

Neovim has no direct connection to the system clipboard. Instead it depends on a *provider* which transparently uses shell commands to communicate with the system clipboard or any other clipboard backend. This means that a clipboard is not functional off the bat and you have to inform Neovim of which clipboard provider you would like it to leverage.

  - The clipboard experience varies depending on if you are using a headless version of a linux distribution or one that supports a GUI.
    - **`XServer/GUI`:**
      - if you are using a linux distro that has a GUI compoment, you can leverage a more robust and user friendly clipboard provider like `xclip` or `xsel`.
      - The presence of a working clipboard tool such as  `xclip` or `xsel` will implictly enable the `+` and `*` registers. Basically just install xclip and neovim will automatically boostrap the clipboard provider allowing for automatiic integration.

    - **`Headless Linux Server`:**
      -  ATM the current config really only supports `tmux` as a clipboard provider for headless linux distros. Clipboard providers such as `xclip` and `xsel` will not function as there is no 'display' to hook into (XServer is not present), thus are not viable options.
      - if you are feeling savy, feel free into into other supported clipboard providers, which can support SSH forwarding and other functionality for headless
      linux servers.

  - It should be noted that the default behavior for `neovim` when it is invoked within a tmux session is to use the `tmux` _clipboard proivder_, unless a more suitable _provider_ is already installed (e.g. `xclip`, `xsel`).
    - If you want to use `tmux` as the clipboard provider regardless if you already have another clipboard provider installed, you can set the `NVIM_CLIP` environment variable to `tmux` in your respective rc file.
      ```bash
      # entry in your repsective rc file (e.g. ~/.bashrc)
      export NVIM_CLIP="tmux"
      ```

  - If you want nothing to do with the clipboard setup, ignore related config errors and allow neovim to implicitly handle things (which also could mean doing nothing), simply set the `NVIM_SKIP_CLIP` env var to `true` in your respective rc file.
    ```bash
    # entry in your repsective rc file (e.g. ~/.bashrc)
    export NVIM_SKIP_CLIP=true
    ```
