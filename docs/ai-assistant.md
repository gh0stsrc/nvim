- If you would like use the `jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim` plugin to integrate neovim with the OpenAI's ChatGPT, there are a couple of prerequisites:
    - you will need a valid OpenAI API Key
    - you will have to securely store said key - this will dictate how you configure the `chatgpt` setup config
      - if you would like to leverage an enviornment variable (env var), create an env var named `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your respective shell's `.rc` (i.e. Run Commands) file.
        - e.g.) `export OPENAI_API_KEY={SECRET_KEY}`
      - **_OTHERWISE_**, you can leverage password manager or keystore to store the API key and have the `chatgpt` plugin retrieve it a system command.
        - if you decide to go down this route, you will need to update the `chatgpt` setup config to invoke a command under the `api_key_cmd` config field. Examples below:

          The following configuration would use 1Passwords CLI, `op`, to fetch the API key from the `credential` field of the `OpenAI` entry.

          ```lua
          require("chatgpt").setup({
            -- example using the 1Password Secret Store CLI
            api_key_cmd = "op read op://private/OpenAI/credential --no-newline"
          })
          ```
          The following configuration would use `GPG` to decrypt a local file containing the
          API key.

          ```lua
          local home = vim.fn.expand("$HOME")
          require("chatgpt").setup({
              -- example using GPG
              api_key_cmd = "gpg --decrypt " .. home .. "/secret.txt.gpg"
          })
          ```
