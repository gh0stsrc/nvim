A simple and powerful setup for neovim.

>[!NOTE]
>Version `1.x.x` leveraged [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as the package manager; however, packer is no longer actively maintained. `v2.x.x` and beyond will leverage [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim/tree/stable) as the defacto package manager (unless stated otherwise).
>
> In addition, it should be noted that this configuration and the instructions outlined, were implemented on a `Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar Lobster)` system using a `v0.9.4` neovim app image; instructions may need to be tailored for other linux distributions or neovim versions.

### Nvim Config Environment Variables
 - `NVIM_LOG_LVL`: by setting this environment variable to either ["TRACE" | "DEBUG" | "INFO" | "WARN" | "ERROR" | "OFF" ], the [`rcarriga/nvim-notify`](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify) plugin will be configured to display notifications upto the desired log level. If the env var `NVIM_LOG_LVL` is not set, the log level is deafult to `INFO`.

 Neovim will open with debugging info, such as the compatible clipboard providers that have been detected, etc.
by setting this environment variable to `true`, Neovim will open with debugging info, such as the compatible clipboard providers that have been detected, etc.
</br>
 
 - `NVIM_SKIP_CLIP`: by setting this environment variable to `true`, you are choosing to skip the configuration of prefered clipboard providers (xclip, xsel, tmux, termux, etc...) and dismiss related errors.
</br>
 
 - `NVIM_CLIP`: Depending on your preference of clipboard provider for Neovim and your currently installed clipboard providers on your system, Neovim may implicitly select a provider and connect the respective registers. If you prefer not to leverage a clipboard like `xclip` or do not have a display (i.e. headless server), you can explictly select `tmux` as your prefered clipboard provider. 

   - To do so, set the `NVIM_CLIP` environment variable to `tmux`. This will configure `tmux` to be your preferred clipboard provider, connect the appropriate registers and set the `<leader> + y`, `<leader> + p` key bindings for copying and pasting, respectively.
 
   - <code style="color : green"><b>Note</b></code>**:** To see more information about clipboard configurations, please see the `Nvim Clipboard Provider Related` subsection of [Nvim Config Installation Prerequisites](#nvim-config-installation-prerequisites).
</br>
 
 - `NVIM_ENABLE_GPT`: by setting this environment variable to `true`, the `jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim` plugin will be able to be installed via `Lazy` upon Neovim restart. In addition, the respective key bindings outlined in the [Noteworthy Key Bindings](#noteworthy-key-bindings) section of this document will be bound.

    - <code style="color : green"><b>Note</b></code>**:** For more information regarding the `ChatGPT` plugin and its installation requirements, please see the respective subsection within [Nvim Config Installation Prerequisites](nvim-config-installation-prerequisites).
    </br>

- `NVIM_DISABLE_MATCHING_HL`: by setting this environment variable to `true`, you will be disabling all symbol match highlighting (e.g. matching open and closing brackets/braces). 
</br>

- `NVIM_ENABLE_BACKUP_COMMENT_COLOR`: This environment variable should **_ONLY_** be used when you are encountering issues with either treesitter or LSPs, where comments are no longer being rendered in green text.

  - To manually override the `gruvbox` colorscheme to render comments in green text, when either treesitter or LSPs are **_NON_**-FUNCTIONAL, set the environment variable to `true`.

- `NVIM_TODO_TUI`: by setting this environment variable to the command of your desired Todo/Tracker TUI (e.g. `todui`), the neovim will automatically bootstrap the integration with `toggleterm`; this will _ONLY_ work if the command is installed on your system (i.e. avaialble via `$PATH`).


---
### Nvim Config Installation Prerequisites

**Terminal Font Related**
  The configuration file `init.lua` explictly references a number of Patched fonts and plugins like `nvim-dap-ui`, `diffview` and `ChatGPT.nvim` leverage implictly do aswell. 
  
  If you do not either patch or get the required patched fonts, `Nerd Fonts` (e.g. Ubuntu Nerd Font) and `Codicons`, you will see _unknown symbols_ and/or warnings from the aforementioned plugins.

  To see how to patch fonts, refer to the [References Section](#references)  

**Lazy Git**
  See the `lazygit` extension subsection in [Terminal UI (TUI) Extensions](#terminal-ui-tui-extensions), to learn more about this git worklfow tool and how it works **_amazingly well_** with `toggleterm`.

  If you decide to join the dark side, all you need to do is simply install `lazygit` on your system ([follow their installation guide](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/tree/master#installation)) and the neovim config will automatically bootstrap `toggleterm` with `lazygit` for you. A dedicated floating terminal window will be available to toggle using the keybindings outlined in the [Noteworthy Key Bindings](#noteworthy-key-bindings) section of this document.

**k9s**
  See the `k9s` extension subsection in [Terminal UI (TUI) Extensions](#terminal-ui-tui-extensions), to learn more about this amazing TUI for interacting with k8s clusters. Its time to leave the plain jane `kubectl` cli in the dust!

  Simply install `k9s` on your system ([follow their installation guide](https://github.com/derailed/k9s#installation)) and the neovim config will automatically bootstrap `toggleterm` with `k9s` for you. A dedicated floating terminal window will be available to toggle using the keybindings outlined in the [Noteworthy Key Bindings](#noteworthy-key-bindings) section of this document.

**Todo/Tracker TUI**
    - you can plugin whichever Todo/Tracker TUI you desire and it will autmatically be bootstrapped by the neovim config and integrated with `toggleterm`. Todo so (pun indended), set the `NVIM_TODO_TUI` environment variable to the command of your desired TUI (e.g. `todui`). This will _ONLY_ work if the command is installed on your system (i.e. avaialble via `$PATH`).
    - see the respective [environment variable section](#nvim-config-environment-variables) for more details

**Nvim Clipboard Provider Related**

  Neovim has no direct connection to the system clipboard. Instead it depends on a _provider_ which transparently uses shell commands to communicate with the system clipboard or any other clipboard backend 

  - The clipboard experience varies depending on if you are using a headless version of a linux distribution or one that supports a GUI.
    - **`XServer/GUI`:**
      - if you are using a linux distro that has a GUI compoment, you can leverage a more robust and user friendly clipboard provider like `xclip` or `xsel`.
      - The presence of a working clipboard tool such as  `xclip` or `xsel` will implictly enable the `+` and `*` registers. Basically just install xclip and neovim will automatically boostrap the clipboard provider allowing for automatiic integration.
      
    - **`Headless Linux Server`:**
      -  ATM the current config really only supports `tmux` as a clipboard provider for headless linux distros. Clipboard providers such as `xclip` and `xsel` will not function as there is no 'display' to hook into (XServer is not present), thus are not viable options.
      - if you are feeling savy, feel free into into other supported clipboard providers, which can support SSH forwarding and other functionality for headless
      linux servers.

  - It should be noted that the default behavior for `neovim` when it is invoked within a tmux session is to use the `tmux` _clipboard proivder_, unless a more suitable _provider_ is already installed (e.g. `xclip`, `xsel`).
    - If you want to use `tmux` as the clipboard provider regardless if you already have another clipboard provider installed, you can set the `NVIM_CLIP` environment variable to `tmux` in your respective rc file.
      ```bash
      # entry in your repsective rc file (e.g. ~/.bashrc)
      export NVIM_CLIP="tmux"
      ```

  - If you want nothing to do with the clipboard setup, ignore related config errors and allow neovim to implicitly handle things (which also could mean doing nothing), simply set the `NVIM_SKIP_CLIP` env var to `true` in your respective rc file.
    ```bash
    # entry in your repsective rc file (e.g. ~/.bashrc)
    export NVIM_SKIP_CLIP=true
    ```

  - to see more details regarding how neovim clipboard providers integrate with neovim and their respective functions, issue the `:help g:clipboard` command 

**Telescope Nvim Plugin Related**
  - `telescope` depends on [BurntSushi/ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for grep-like operations.
    -  the easiest way to deal with this is to install `ripgrep` system wide
      - `sudo apt-get install ripgrep`
    - **_OTHERWISE_**, when you run the `lazy install` command, `ripgrep` will automatically be installed via `lazy`; as it is included in the `lazy` setup config. HOWEVER, you will need to make the binary accessible to `$PATH`.
      - <code style="color : red"><b>IMPORTANT</b></code> 
        - <code style="color : red"> you will need to include the full path of where the `ripgrep` binary was installed in `$PATH`</code> 
    
  
  - `telescope` **_optionally_** depends on [sharkdp/fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) for file finding functionality.
    -  the easiest way to deal with this is to install `fd-find` system wide
      - `sudo apt-get install fd-find`
      - after successful installation, you will also need to create a _symbolic link_ to for `fd-find`, to be available for use as expected in documentation and by nvim plugins (i.e. called by `fd` and not `fdfind`).
        - `ln -s $(which fdfind) ~/.local/bin/fd`
          - Ensure that `$HOME/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH`.

**Treesitter Nvim Plugin Related**
  - if you encounter any parser-related errors when excuting the `:checkhealth` command in neovim, do not be alarmed. This is most likely caused by the tresitter pareser components wither missing on intial install or update to the `"nvim-treesitter.configs"` setup; to resolve this run the following command 
    - `:TSUpdate`
    -  [Please see a related Github issue for more details](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim/issues/3680#issuecomment-1372345560)

**Python Related**
  - If you will be using the Python LSP, you may notice a number of warnings related to Python when you execute the `:checkhealth` command in neovim. These warnings should be recommend optional resolutions; however, if the issues no longer are optional or if you encounter issues with the Python env or LSP, Install the follow modules globally and address any other issues raised:
    - **`pythonX-pip`:**
      ```bash
      # install pip module for python3 at the system level
      sudo apt install python3_pip
      ```
    - **`pythonX-neovim`:**
      ```bash
      # install the neovim module for python3 at the system level
      sudo apt install python3_neovim
      ```

**ChatGPT Nvim Plugin Related**
  - If you would like use the `jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim` plugin to integrate neovim with the OpenAI's ChatGPT, there are a couple of prerequisites
    - you will need a valid OpenAI API Key
    - you will have to securely store said key - this will dictate how you configure the `chatgpt` setup config
      - if you would like to leverage an enviornment variable (env var), create an env var named `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your respective shell's _rc_ (i.e. Run Commands) file.
        - e.g.) `export OPENAI_API_KEY={SECRET_KEY}`
      - **_OTHERWISE_**, you can leverage password manager or keystore to store the API key and have the `chatgpt` plugin retrieve it a system command.
        - if you decide to go down this route, you will need to update the `chatgpt` setup config to invoke a command under the `api_key_cmd` config field. Examples below: <br /><br />

          The following configuration would use 1Passwords CLI, `op`, to fetch the API key from the `credential` field of the `OpenAI` entry.

          ```lua
          require("chatgpt").setup({
            -- example using the 1Password Secret Store CLI
            api_key_cmd = "op read op://private/OpenAI/credential --no-newline"
          })
          ```
          The following configuration would use `GPG` to decrypt a local file containing the
          API key.

          ```lua
          local home = vim.fn.expand("$HOME")
          require("chatgpt").setup({
              -- example using GPG
              api_key_cmd = "gpg --decrypt " .. home .. "/secret.txt.gpg"
          })
          ```

### Nvim Config Validation

After addressing [Nvim Config Installation Prerequisites](#nvim-config-installation-prerequisites), you should check the overall status of your neovim setup by excuting the `:checkhealth` command

The `:checkhealth` command runs a series of diagnostic tests to check the health of your Neovim installation. If it uncovers any problems, it usually offers suggestions on how to fix them, or where to go to learn more.

If you find and relvant `Warnings` which may impact your nvim setup or experience, OR any `Errors`, follow the guidance provide and address their resolution accordingly.

- **_How to Patch Fonts_**:
    - Manually Patching a Font
      - [Font Patching Procedure](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#option-9-patch-your-own-font)
      - Once a font is patched, move the respective `.ttf` file to the running user's font dir (e.g. `~/.local/share/fonts/FontName.ttf`) or in a well named subdirectory (e.g. `~/.local/share/fonts/Ubuntu/FontName.ttf`
    - Using already Patched Fonts
      - Dowload a patched font from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
      - Move the respective `.ttf` file(s) to the running user's font dir (e.g. `~/.local/share/fonts/FontName.ttf`) or in a well named subdirectory (e.g. `~/.local/share/fonts/Ubuntu/FontName.ttf`)
